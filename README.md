# Lab 1, Part B

## Directions

Using class separation, implement a `Student` class according to the following UML diagram:

The implementation details should be straightforward. For the constructor, make it display the message *Student object created!*. For the destructor, make it display the message *Student object destroyed!*.

## Sample Run

The following is a sample run of my solution. You can use this as a model to aim for with your program.

```
Student object created!
Student object created!
Student object created!
Student object created!
Student object created!
Enter the name for student #1: Patricia Perez
Enter the age for student #1: 29
Enter the name for student #2: Carmen
Enter the age for student #2: 23
Enter the name for student #3: Albert DeLeon
Enter the age for student #3: 16
Enter the name for student #4: Brandon W Perry
Enter the age for student #4: 54
Enter the name for student #5: Nicole Henderson
Enter the age for student #5: 30
Student #1
    Name: Patricia Perez
    Age: 29

Student #2
    Name: Carmen
    Age: 23
